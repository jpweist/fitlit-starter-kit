# FitLit Fitness wellness tracker

#### Shown above is the screen shot of the fitlit app
It takes the User, Hydration, Sleep and possibly the Activity data and creates
classes and then displays the related info on the DOM. The layout has the
Hydration, sleep and activity data at the top of the page. In the main section
we have the user and their data. Then on the right hand side we have 3 circles
with the friend data from the user. We wanted to show competitive data for the
user for competitiveness. Ideally the user would click on one of the boxes of
data and that would be the main feature. Then the right hand side would change to
competitive data that corresponds to that section.

Currently the app just has rollovers for the different data sections. The app
makes a new random user each time the page is loaded.
